# EpicGuard - Server protection plugin
More information, reviews and preview, on the [Resource Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/72369/)

## Supported Platforms
* Bukkit, Spigot, Paper etc.. [1.8.x - 1.15.x]
  * Our main version contains most features and is our top priority. It contains additional features, which cannot be done on the Proxy servers, like command blocker, anti backdoor etc.
* BungeeCord, Waterfall etc.
  * Our second version, designed for proxies based on BungeeCord. It contains the same AntiBot features as other platforms. It does not contain spigot-only modules, as proxy servers are limited in their possibilities.
* Velocity
  * Our third version, designed for Velocity proxy, which is not a fork of BungeeCord. This is the most efficient version of the EpicGuard because Velocity is greatly optimized. It contains the same AntiBot features as other platforms. It does not contain spigot-only modules, as proxy servers are limited in their possibilities.

## Features
* Highly configurable and customizable.
* Almost no performance impact. If configured correctly, you wouldn't even notice there is an attack on your server!
* Blocking VPN services and proxies.
  * Simple proxy checking - enabled by default, it doesn't require any configuration, but setting API key is highly recommended.
  * Advanced proxy checking - only for advanced users, you can set up as many proxy checkers as you want.
* See more about your players, in GUI or in the command:
  * Player's UUID.
  * Player's country.
  * Player's city.
  * Player's address history.
  * Player's hostname.
* Country filter - allow or block specified countries.
* Disable vanilla operator mechanics.
* Block namespace commands (these which contains ':' symbol, like 'minecraft:me' or 'essentials:say').
* Fast attack detection, you can configure on which connect/ping speed attack will be detected.
* Automatic whitelisting, so real players won't be detected by antibot, and they can join while bots can't.
* You can set up the list with the Trusted Operators - only people on this list can have operator permissions.
* Block specific commands that you don't want players/staff to execute.
* Configure a list of allowed commands that can regular players execute.
* Display custom tab-completion (on /<tab>), or completely disable tab completion.
* Manage your server using GUI instead of annoying commands!
* Cloud blacklist synchronizing (soon).
* ActionBar notifications, so you can see the attack status.
* Are you tired of your console spammed by the useless messages? Now you can filter console messages.
